# Hi folks ‚úã

My name is Clement Francois and I am a software developper. I'm from France and I am French, I am living in Toulouse and I am 24 years old which 
means that I finished my schools since 2020. However when I was 22 years old, during the May month precisely in May the fifth, I got a car accident
and I then got hospitalized for 7 months. But now that this episode is finished and I can recover my life on my own.

I try first to working on JavaScript, TypeScript with frameworks like Angular and ReactJS to have a visual render üòÅ
