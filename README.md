# Hi folks âœ‹

My name is Clement Francois and I am a software developper. 

I'm from France, I am 24 years old and I am living in Toulouse. 
However when I was 22 years old, during in May the fifth, I got a car accident
and I then got hospitalized for 7 months (from May to October). But now that this episode is over, I can recover my life on my own.
